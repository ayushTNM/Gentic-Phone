# Usage
To use this script, a Gemini API key is needed. This key can be obtained for free 
(see https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key). Once the key has been obtained,
it needs to be set as the environment variable API_KEY. In a Unix environment, this 
can be done with the following command:
``export API_KEY="your_key"``
Now, the script can be run with the command ``python3 ./main.py``.
